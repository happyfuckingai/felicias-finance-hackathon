# Target Architecture Components - Felicia's Finance

## Overview

The final Felicia's Finance system will be a **production-ready, enterprise-grade hybrid banking platform** that orchestrates complex financial workflows through intelligent AI agents. Built on Google Cloud's ADK framework with A2A protocol communication, the system maintains strict separation between systems and agents.

## Core Architectural Principles

### 1. Clean Separation: Systems â‰  Agents
- **Systems** (Bank of Anthos, Crypto Infrastructure) provide capabilities through APIs
- **Agents** (Felicia, Orchestrator) use tools to access systems without embedding AI
- **Never mix agent logic into core financial systems**

### 2. Event-Driven Communication
- All components communicate through events and messages
- Real-time status updates and progress tracking
- Asynchronous processing for complex workflows

### 3. Security First
- End-to-end encryption for all communications
- Zero-trust architecture with comprehensive audit logging
- Multi-factor authentication and authorization

### 4. Scalable by Design
- Microservices architecture with Kubernetes orchestration
- Auto-scaling based on load and usage patterns
- Global distribution with edge computing
