# Felicia's Finance Agent Core Constitution

## Core Principles

### I. Agent-First Architecture
Every feature starts as a standalone agent or service; Agents must be self-contained, independently testable, documented; Clear purpose required - no organizational-only agents.

### II. Secure Delegation Interface
Every agent exposes functionality via secure delegation protocols; Authentication/authorization required: token-based auth, role-based access, encrypted communications; Support structured request/response protocols with error handling.

### III. Test-First (NON-NEGOTIABLE)
TDD mandatory: Tests written → Security reviewed → Tests fail → Then implement; Red-Green-Refactor cycle strictly enforced for all agents and financial operations.

### IV. Integration Testing
Focus areas requiring integration tests: Agent communication contract tests, Financial transaction validations, Cross-agent security boundaries, Regulatory compliance checks, Memory system integrations.

### V. Observability, Versioning & Security-First
Version format: MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH for breaking/non-breaking/security changes; Strict security-first approach: Encrypt sensitive data, audit all financial operations, validate all inputs; Comprehensive logging required for compliance and debugging.

## Security & Compliance Requirements

Technology stack must support financial-grade security: End-to-end encryption, PCI DSS compliance capabilities, SOC 2 alignment; Deployment policies require security reviews, penetration testing, compliance audits before production deployment; Data retention policies must comply with financial regulations; Access controls: Multi-factor authentication required for all financial operations.

## Agent Development Workflow

Code review requirements: Security review mandatory for all financial operations, peer review for agent logic, automated security scanning; Testing gates: Unit tests for agent logic, integration tests for agent communications, security tests for financial operations; Deployment approval process: Security sign-off required, gradual rollout with monitoring, rollback capability for financial systems.

## Governance

This constitution supersedes all other practices for Felicia's Finance Agent Core development. Amendments require security impact assessment, approval from technical leads and compliance officer, detailed migration plan for existing agents and financial operations. All development must verify compliance with these principles; Complexity must be justified with security and regulatory rationale; Use agent-specific guidance files for runtime development guidance.
