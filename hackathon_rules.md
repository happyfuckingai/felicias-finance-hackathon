Each Submission will receive a Final score from 1 to 5.8, with the highest possible Final score being 5.8.

The highest-scoring Submission for each region (North America, Latin America, Europe-Middle East-Africa, Asia Pacific) will be selected as the potential winner(s). The highest-scoring Submission across all regions will win the Grand Prize. Ties will be broken by comparing scores on each criterion in the order listed, and if a tie remains, judges will vote. If a potential winner is disqualified, the Submission with the next highest score will become the potential winner. Determinations of judges are final and binding.

The award of a prize to a potential winner is subject to verification of the identity, qualifications and role of the potential winner in the creation of the Submission. No Submission or individual shall be deemed a winning Submission or winner until their post-competition prize affidavits have been completed and verified, even if prospective winners have been announced verbally or on the competition website. The final decision to designate a winner shall be made by the Sponsor and/or Administrator. A Submission can win a maximum of one prize. In the event that no entries are received for a region, no prize will be awarded.

On or about October 10, 2025, the potential winner(s) will be selected and may be notified by email, at Sponsor’s discretion for Winner Verification Requirement (as defined below). If a potential winner does not respond to the notification attempt within two days from the first notification attempt, then such potential winner will be disqualified and an alternate potential winner will be selected from among all eligible entries received based on the judging criteria described herein.  Except where prohibited by law, each potential winner may be required to sign and return a Declaration of Eligibility and Liability and Publicity Release and provide any additional information that may be required by Sponsor.  If required, potential winners must return all such required documents within two days following attempted notification or such potential winner will be deemed to have forfeited the prize and another potential winner will be selected based on the judging criteria described herein. All notification requirements, as well as other requirements within these Rules, will be strictly enforced.

The public Winner Announcement will take place at KubeCon on or around November 10 - 13, 2025. 

“Winner Verification Requirement” means THE AWARD OF A PRIZE TO A POTENTIAL WINNER IS SUBJECT TO VERIFICATION OF THE IDENTITY, QUALIFICATIONS AND ROLE OF THE POTENTIAL WINNER IN THE CREATION OF THE SUBMISSION. No Submission or individual shall be deemed a winning Submission or winner until their post-competition prize affidavits have been completed and verified, even if prospective winners have been announced verbally or on the competition website.

Dear GKE Turns 10 Hackathon Team,

I hope this email finds you well. My name is [Ditt Namn] and I am writing regarding my submission for the GKE Turns 10 Hackathon.

Issue Encountered:
I have completed my project "Felicia's Finance" - an AI-driven hybrid banking platform that integrates Bank of Anthos with advanced crypto-banking capabilities using agentic AI orchestration. However, I encountered a technical issue when attempting to submit:

The demonstration video file size exceeded the platform's upload limits. Despite multiple attempts to compress and optimize the video, the file remained too large for the submission portal.

Project Overview:
My submission demonstrates:

Integrated Architecture: Bank of Anthos + Felicia's Finance crypto-banking system
Agentic AI Orchestration: Multi-agent workflows using Google's ADK and A2A protocols
MCP Server Integration: Three production-ready MCP servers deployed on Google Cloud Run
Google Web3 Integration: Native blockchain connectivity for DeFi operations
Production Deployment: Complete microservices architecture with monitoring and security
Repository Available:
All project code, documentation, and technical details are available at:
https://github.com/happyfuckingai/Felicias_financegke

Alternative Demonstration Request:
I have prepared the demonstration video for the final minutes of development and would be happy to present my project through:

Screen sharing session - I can demonstrate the complete system functionality live
Video call presentation - Walk through the architecture and show live demos
Detailed documentation review - All technical specifications and code are documented
Proposed Solution:
I respectfully request the opportunity to demonstrate my project through a brief screen sharing session or video call, where I can show:

The complete integrated system running
Live demonstration of the AI agent orchestration
Real-time interaction with the MCP servers
The production deployment architecture
Contact Information:

Email: [Din Email]
Timezone: CET (Stockholm, Sweden)
Availability: Flexible - I can accommodate most time slots
I am extremely proud of what I've built and would greatly appreciate the opportunity to properly demonstrate the innovative hybrid banking platform I've created. The project represents significant technical achievement in AI-agent orchestration and production-ready microservices deployment.

Thank you for your understanding and consideration.

Best regards,

[Ditt Namn]

Felicia's Finance - GKE Turns 10 Hackathon Participant
