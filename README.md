This repository contains the public-facing components of our hackathon submission, including:1. The complete source code for the BankOfAnthos_MCP_Server, which acts as an intelligent adapter for the Bank of Anthos backend.2. The source code for our Streamlit-based Command Center UI.3. An architectural overview of the complete federated system.Please note: The core components of our proprietary HappyOS ecosystem (including the AnalysisAndTaskEngine, UltimateOrchestrator, and the advanced AI DeFi engine) are part of our core intellectual property and are not included in this public repository. The crypto_mcp_server is provided in a simulated mode.The code provided is sufficient to run the demo and verify the architecture and the quality of our engineering. The core innovation lies in the federated multi-agent architecture itself, which is fully explained and demonstrated.
